# Tulip_Park_Demo_2025
A demo real-estate and community website built using the Bolt.new no-code platform as part of my personal learning initiative. The project showcases available flats for rent or sale, along with a dedicated event gallery to highlight the culture and celebrations within the Tulip Park society — promoting the spirit of “One Family.”

Key Features:
1. 🌗 Light/Dark mode toggle
2. 🏘️ Flat listings with real-time availability
3. 🖼️ Event gallery of past celebrations
4. 🔐 Admin mode for editing flat details and managing events/images
5. 💬 Tulip Park Assistant chatbot for user interaction
6. 📩 Contact form and About page

Note: This is a personal learning project. Some data is demo-only, and the site is not officially deployed.
